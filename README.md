# Discord-Welcome-Bot

As the title says, it's a simple discord-welcome-bot, very primitive in style. Built it to finish Global Hack Week Share (2022)'s challenge to build a discord bot with autocode.
Built with my friend as a challenge.

Part of the bot sends motivational texts (hence the name "Motivation Bot". This part was built by my partner "Ahmedsaed") and the other part welcomes new-comers.
